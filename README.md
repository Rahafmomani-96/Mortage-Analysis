# Mortage-Analysis
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze mortgage loans from different perspectives — closing timelines, loan balances, trade execution, profit margins, and more.  It’s built to give mortgage professionals, analysts, and anyone interested in loan data a clear, visual way to monitor performance and drive better decisions.
